# Pomodoro Timer
------

This is a pomodoro timer built with React.

I decided to build this timer when I couldn't find one online that I truly liked.

As the saying goes, "If you want something done right, do it yourself."

Well, not that the other ones I found online weren't done right, they just were not to my liking. ðŸ˜…

Okay, enough of that, if you have not heard about the pomodoro technique, check [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "Pomodoro Technique") out.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
